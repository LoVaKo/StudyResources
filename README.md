# StudyResources

Welcome to **StudyResources**! This repository is a curated collection of resources - kicked off with some AI magic, but it's going to evolve over time - designed to help anyone who is just starting out in IT, programming, or tech in general. As a tech trainer and host of the Women's Coding Club, I've often found myself recommending the same resources over and over to people who are eager to break into the tech industry. Whether you're looking for courses, tutorials, assignments, or other learning materials, this repo aims to gather everything in one convenient place.

This repository is dynamic and will continue to evolve. As I come across new and helpful resources, I'll add them here, ensuring that everyone can have easy access to up-to-date materials.

## What you'll find in this repo:
- **Beginner-friendly resources** for those just getting started with programming and IT.
- **Courses and tutorials** on a variety of topics, including programming languages, web development, data science, and more.
- **Assignments and projects** to help you practice and build your skills.
- **Articles, videos, and blog posts** that offer valuable insights into different tech topics.
- **Personal projects** and examples that I’ve used in my own training sessions.

This repository is constantly being updated, so feel free to check back regularly for new additions. I encourage you to explore, share, and use these resources to enhance your learning journey. Whether you’re a complete beginner or someone looking to expand your knowledge, you’ll find something valuable here!
